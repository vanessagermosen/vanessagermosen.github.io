	<h1>About Me</h1>
</head>
<body>
    <p>I'm a Design Director living in New York City. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because my team is currently being tasked with designing artwork for various digital projects (apps, web games, etc.). I want to make sure I understand the process and limitations of web design so that I can better manage the visual assets we provide.</p>

	<h2>My Mission</h2>
</head>
<body>
	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope that I can become as well rounded as possible in my current position. I like to work as an artist with a steady income and my current job allows me to do just that with the added bonus of a team of people I respect and enjoy working with. Ideally I would like to have a thorough understanding of web design, technical terms, and web limitations so that when projects are assigned to me I can communicate effectively between what our producers and coders request and what my team and myself can create.</p>

<h2>Other</h2>

<body>I use my free time to develop my own varying projects from oil painting to toy design.
     <p>
     	Currently I'm focusing on "Germusu", a line of characters inspired by germs. I use them to help teach that not all germs are bad, some are super useful and some are pretty awesome. I used the character designs to create little pouches and posters and other items. They can be seen at
