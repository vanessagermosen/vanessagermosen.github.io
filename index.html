		<p><h2><u>QUESTION 1</u></p> 
		Find two different websites' layout and design you admire.</h2>
		<ul><h3>
				<li>Describe how each website exhibits effective use of space, size or balance.</li>
	  			<li>Describe ways each website can benefit from a reexamination of space, size or balance.</li>
	  		</h3>
	  		Websites Chosen: 
			<a href="http://www.futurefabric.co.uk">Futurefabric.co.uk</a>  & 
			<a href="http://www.Minimalmonkey.com">Minimalmonkey.com</a>.
				<p><strong>Futurefabric.co.uk</strong></p>
	  			<u>Effective Use of Balance:</u>
	  			<p>When viewed in full screen mode, this site does a really nice job at using varying sized squares to bring your focus to the content of most importance. I like that the photo images are encased in flat color negative space. It creates a quilt that allows your eyes to move from the larger image to the smaller detailed ones.</p> 
				<u>Reexamination</u>
	  			<p>While I enjoyed the big window-filling layout of the home screen, going into the links and having the same large window-filling images was a bit overwhelming. When text was added into these pages, it somehow becomes disconnected. I can either read or see the image but not both. It's hard to appreciate the image in it's entirety when the browser is cutting it off.  Maybe this was the artist's intention but it feels off to me as an outsider. It's a problem only happening in full screen mode and is especially true when viewing the page

	  			</p> 
				<p><strong>Minimalmonkey.com</strong></p>
	  			<u>Effective Use of Space:</u>
	  			<p>I love the fresh approach to presenting previews of an article's text with a large colored negative space underneath. Unlike other article driven sites that bombard with images and text, this one feels so serene, almost quiet. I feel like I'm being allowed to take my time and read through the different pieces of content with nothing in particular fighting for my attention.</p> 
				<u>Reexamination</u>
	  			<p>I think that this minimal design may put off users that need a picture to be enticed to click through. However, it may be a deliberate decision on the designer's part to seek only users that can appreciate a minimal design aesthetic.
	  			</p> 
			</ul>
			<p><h2><u>QUESTION 2</u></p> Compare the two layouts. What makes them different? What are the similarities in both that appeal to you?</h2><p>
			<ul>
		 		<p><strong>Futurefabric.co.uk</strong>
	  			uses different sized image boxes in a grid-type layout. There are larger boxes that draw your attention first and are obviously more important.
				This site requires you to scroll down the page to see the rest of the content and they prompt you to do so by cutting off some of the images along the bottom of the screen.</p> 
				<p><strong>Minimalmonkey.com </strong>
	  			uses colored columns in a uniform size informing us visually that all of the articles are of equal importance.
				This site also uses a cutoff to prompt you to explore more content but does so in a side scroll layout.</p> 
				<p>The similarities that appeal to me about these two sites are their strong, bold use of colored negative space. I like that both sites' homepage layouts fill up the majority of the browser, allowing for an immersive experience but the large blocks of negative color space are used effectively and do not overpower the visual experience.</p>
			</ul>
			<p><h2><u>QUESTION 3</u></p>Google "thumbnail layout sketches" and compare and contrast various solutions. What makes one solution more clear than another?</h2>
				<ul> 
				<p><strong>THUMBNAIL A:</strong></p>
				<p>This thumbnail is very clear in terms of both where all items go in the layout and what the icons represent. Even without a key, I know right away that there are images going in the x-ed boxes and copy going on the lines boxes.</p>
				<img src="http://www.foreui.com/images/demo_web_store.jar.gif">
				<p><strong>THUMBNAIL B:</strong></p>
				<p>For this thumbnail I feel like I would need to meet with the person who created it to know exactly what the shapes and larger boxes represent. Apart from the box with the "play" button (which to me represents "video") I really have no idea what the difference is between the blank boxes, oval, and circles. I also don't know if the 4 boxes represent 4 different ideas for 1 page or 1 idea of a page with 4 boxes.</p>

			<p><h2><u>QUESTION 4</u></p>Based on the feedback you provided for the above two mentioned websites, using primitives, i.e., lines and basic shapes, create a series of thumbnail sketches for the different pages of a site you'd like to create.</h2>
			<ul><h3>
				<li>Create at least two thumbnail sketches for each page of the site.</li>

	  			<li>Note how each of the thumbnail sketches demonstrate focal point, hierarchy, and balance across different grid-based layouts.</li>
	  			</h3>
	  			<h2>Thumbnail sketches</h2>
	  			<p>The site I would like to create is an information homepage for a brand of DYI doll sewing kits being sold through Etsy. Along with the kit, I'll have other doll branded items for sale like totes and prints being sold through print on demand sites like Society6 and Spoonflower. Since all the links on this homepage take you to already existing sites, I've focused my thumbnails on the homepage layout only.</p>
	  			<p><strong>THUMBNAIL 1:</strong></p>
	  			<p>For this first thumbnail, I want the focal point to be a hero shot of the finished product so I've made it the largest visual on the page.
				Since this product image will take up most of the left side, I'll balance out the layout by using some copy and two smaller images to the right along with a call to action link to the store where product will be sold.
				A bold headline underneath this main page layout is cut off by the browser window and will be used to prompt the viewer to scroll down. This action will show the viewer a few more branded products available at other various online stores. The products are not as special as those sold on Etsy so I've planed for those images to be smaller than the secondary images on the top.
				The logo is not as important so I've kept it fairly small on the upper left of the page. It's balanced out to the right by link buttons used for both store and social media links.</p>

				<p><strong>THUMBNAIL 2:</strong></p>
	  			<p>For this second thumbnail, I wanted to showcase the variety of finished products in equal scale. This layout will allow the focus to be on just the product itself and not have it get too cluttered by steps images or copy.
				A large bold headline above the images gives a bit of context to the product.
				Logo and store links are centered on top while the social media links stay on the upper right. The social media links will be more subdued in styling so that they don't get too heavy on the upper right side.
				As the viewer scrolls down, prompted by the cut-off copy, they'll see a visual of the simple steps used to create the doll in the kit.
				Below that, a smaller headline prompts the viewer to explore the other branded product offerings showcased with images and supported by links to the stores where they can be purchased.</p>

				<p><strong>THUMBNAIL 3:</strong></p>
	  			<p>For this third thumbnail, I wanted to take a bit of a departure from the super structured layout and go into more of a wacky quilt layout. While the bigger image squares will still showcase the more important finished product, they will be balanced out on the page by the smaller images of branded product.
				Interspersed between will be the links to the various sites that sell the product and some copy. I kept the links spaced out in a way where you see either all 3 or partials as you scroll down the page.
				The key to balancing out this layout will be to use images that have negative space around them so that this busy layout won't become too cluttered.
				The logo will be centered on the top of the page, balanced out on either side by the links to purchase and social media.</p>
